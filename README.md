# XGBoost-RandomForest

In this practice, I utilised a tabular dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/code

I first cleaned the dataset and did some exploratory data analysis.

However, the main focus of this practice was to create a model using XGBoost and compare it with Random Forest to predict stroke. 

I also verified if the models had any high bias or high variance by calculating RMSE (root mean square error).
