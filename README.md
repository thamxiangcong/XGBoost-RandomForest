# XGBoost-RandomForest

In this practice, I utilised a tabular dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/code

I first cleaned the dataset and did some exploratory data analysis.
However, the main focus of this practice is to create a model using XGBoost and compare it with Random Forest.
